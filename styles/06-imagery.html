<h2>ADA Compliance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each non-decorative image (logos, etc.) on the page should include a text alternative (+ SEO value).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Include the srcset attribute on images to serve for improved performances on smaller devices. To save traffic, at least <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30087595">Chrome will render the largest version if loaded previously or is in cache</a>.</li>
</ul>
`<img src="https://placehold.it/700x200" srcset="https://placehold.it/700x200 700w, https://placehold.it/500x200 500w, https://placehold.it/1000x1000 2x" alt="Text alternative to the image" />`
<img src="https://placehold.it/700x200" srcset="https://placehold.it/700x200 700w, https://placehold.it/500x200 500w" alt="Text alternative to the image" />

<h2>Image links</h2>
<ul>
  <li>External links where normal navigation wouldn't normally return the user back to the site should be target="_blank".</li>
  <li>Try to avoid titles since they <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/01/using-the-html-title-attribute-updated/">are not well supported</a>.</li>
  <li>Images that are links <a href="https://a11yproject.com/posts/alt-text/">should describe where they go</a>.</li>
</ul>
