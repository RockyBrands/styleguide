title: Styles
description: The attributes of the brand
---

Styles are guidelines for core brand attributes, organized by category. These are descriptions of conventions that cut across component and suggest the rules that go into building/designing components and their treatment. Like the <a href="{{ "/guidelines/index.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Guidelines</a>, each of these pages is effectively a reference article on how to use and approach the specific subject area.

## Colors
We should be aware of the most common color deficiencies and test for them. Avoid using color alone to communicate information. You can use tools like [https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter), [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/) for offline, and [Sim Daltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/) for mac.
