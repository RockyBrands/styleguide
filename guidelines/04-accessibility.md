For inspiration, check out [Salesforce's Lightning Design System accessibility guidelines](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/), and be sure to check out the fantastic [a11yproject](http://a11yproject.com) for an accessibility checklist, patterns, and resources.

It might be a good idea to test your site with a keyboard only, color blind tests, and using a screen reader.
